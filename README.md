# Web-API-Code-Quiz

<h2> Deployed links</h2>

<h2> Description </h2>

Making a quiz about code with API web application, js, css, index. html. In this project I've applied a lot of what I've learnt about API onto this quiz. The .addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in js. It's a procedure in js that waits for an event to occur. It takes the event to listen for and a second argument to be called whenver the desrived event gets fired. 
document.getElementbyId() returns an element with a specified value. If it returns null then the element doesn't exist. It's a common method in html.doc.
